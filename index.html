          <h1>Relationships between health risks and economic indices</h1>
          <h3>Poverty</h3>
          <p>We found that there is a positive relationship between poverty and health risks. People with the higher poverty level have higher risks to get obeses, smoke more, and cannot afford the healthcare.</p>
          
          <h3>Age</h3>
          <p>Most people in our dataset are between 34 and 44 years old. There is no significant relationship between age and health risks; we could only tell that how many percentages are obeses, smoking, and lacking healthcare in this age range.</p>
          
          <h3>Household Income</h3>
          <p>There is a nagative relationship between household income and health risks. People with higher income level are less likely to get obese, smoke, and lack healthcare.</p>
