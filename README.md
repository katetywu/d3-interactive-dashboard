## Introduction
In this project, we are interested in figuring out the the relationship between health risks and demographics(economic indices) that we will create an interactive graph to show the result.

## Dataset & Variables
The dataset included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). We have rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. on a state-level used in this analysis.
